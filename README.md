#  Wikipedia Encyclopedia Clone

##  The Idea of the Project
This project is a simplified Wikipedia-style encyclopedia web application. It allows users to view, search for, create, edit, and randomly browse content pages written in Markdown. The system processes Markdown into HTML for display and maintains all entries in a structured format. The goal was to build a lightweight CMS-style app with core content management features and intuitive navigation.

##  The Features
- View encyclopedia entries with Markdown-to-HTML rendering
- Search functionality with:
  - Exact match redirection
  - Partial match suggestions
- Add new encyclopedia entries
- Edit existing entries
- Prevent creation of duplicate entries
- Random article button to discover entries
- Clean and responsive layout using HTML and CSS

##  What I Have Learned
- Built a full Django app from scratch using function-based views
- Handled form submission and data validation
- Used Django URL routing and templates effectively
- Implemented basic Markdown processing using `markdown2`
- Ensured a clean UI with reusable templates and logical navigation
- Practiced error handling and user input control (e.g., duplicate entry prevention)
- Strengthened skills in working with filesystem-based content (rather than databases)
